# Drama Writing Guide

Purpose: keep generated scripts cinematic, character-driven, and structurally tight.

1) Core tone  
- Grounded emotion first, then spectacle; never pure gag writing.  
- Stakes visible in every scene (loss, deadline, relationship risk).  

2) Structure & rhythm  
- 3–5 scenes max; each scene must move plot or reveal character.  
- Open with a hook question or visual surprise; end scenes on a tilt/mini-cliff.  
- Maintain clear escalation: setup → complication → reversal → payoff.  

3) Characters & dialogue  
- Give each speaker a goal and a pressure point; let goals collide on the page.  
- Dialogue is concise, subtext-heavy; avoid exposition dumps.  
- Voices distinct via word choice, pace, and attitude; no generic lines.  

4) Visual storytelling  
- Show, don’t tell: externalize emotions via actions, props, blocking, and light.  
- Include precise sensory cues (sound, texture, temperature) to anchor mood.  
- Camera notes sparingly: when they sharpen tension or reveal power dynamics.  

5) Dramatic tension toolkit  
- Use reversals (期待 vs. 现实), time pressure, moral dilemma, or asymmetry of information.  
- Prefer cause-and-effect beats over coincidences; outcomes must feel earned.  
- Keep humor (if any) character-based, not random; let tension snap back quickly.  

6) Style guardrails  
- Language: vivid but economical; avoid purple prose.  
- Avoid clichés, deus ex machina, and instant resolutions.  
- Keep scene formatting clean: one line for slug, one block for action/dialogue.
